                  both the start and end times of each report, where the end time
                  of one report becomes the start time of the next report. Separate
                  jobs are created to generate a report, and the job generates the
                  report data from archived audit and traffic data. To ensure this
                  data is actually archived, the jobs to generate each report starts
                  at a configurable time *after* the end time of the report that is
                  being generated. The default job start delay is 30m, but is configurable
                  through the compliance-controller environments. The cron format
                  has minute accuracy, but only up to two values may be configured
                  for the minute column which means you may only have at most two
                  reports for each hour period.

                            matching the selector will be matched. \n Note that: in
